Earned 7 badges (2025-April to 2025 May)
Today I very delighted to share my badges received from AWS Educate for completing training series, which includes Storage, Compute, Database, Serverless, Networking, Security services and cloud Operations.
Where I had gained good knowledge on these services from training session and also practical experience through their simulations(Labs).
In Storge services I learned about EBS,EFS and S3.In simulation create S3 bucket and hosted a static website.
In compute services I learned about EC2, EKS, ECS and EBS for EC2.In simulation launched EC2 instance and connected.
In Database services I learned about SQL and NoSQL databases and RDS, DynamoDB, Document DynamoDB. In simulation created an RDS MySQL engine instance.
In Serverless services I learned about AWS Lambda, container supported service AWS Fargate as well as monitoring, modifying and provisioning.
In simulation I created lambda functions and triggered to AWS S3 buckets.
In Networking services I learned VPC and its components such as Subnets, Security Groups, Gateway, Route tables and ACL network. In simulation established a VPC and fixed it to EC2 instance
In Security services I learned IAM users, groups and roles for providing access and In simulation created some IAM Users and added in groups as well as IAM roles.
Thank to so much! AWS Educate for such a wonderful and knowledgeful training course which boosted my AWS cloud learning.

Became AWS Educate Member(July 2025)
Proud to be a new member of the AWS Educate Emerging Talent Community! My experience with AWS Educate has been incredibly enriching. Beyond completing 7-8 courses (Computer, Storage, Networking etc.)and gaining hands-on knowledge of AWS services, I've also delved into real-world applications by reading in-depth AWS blogs and analyzing compelling company case studies.

This holistic approach to learning is truly accelerating my understanding of cloud computing. Looking forward to connecting with the community, sharing insights, and exploring future opportunities.
Excited to learn more about AWS cloud and work in my highly interested field AI and GenAI by research on Amazon Bedrock and do projects on Building AI agents, understanding about Foundational Models and so on.
Thank for AWS for such a wonderful platform.

Completed Building Generative AI Apllications Using Amazon Bedrock (July 2025)
What an incredible learning journey! I'm proud to announce my completion and certification in the Amazon Bedrock Getting Started Training Course through AWS Skill Builder. This program has truly opened my eyes to the transformative potential of generative AI.
Throughout the course, I've solidified my understanding of crucial concepts essential for building intelligent applications:
 * Generative AI: The art of creating unique content through AI.
 * Foundation Models: The backbone of modern AI, ready for diverse applications. (Amazon Titan, Antropic- Claud3, Stability AI- Stable diffusion, and others)
 * Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): A game-changer for building accurate and context-aware AI solutions by leveraging external knowledge bases.
*Frameworks: Lang Chain for developing app powered by LLM's, which provides software building blocks to reduce the complexity of building from scratch of LLM.
*Bed Rock Integrations: model, prompt templates, agents 
 * Knowledge Bases: How to effectively manage and integrate vast amounts of information to power smarter AI. Fine-tuning to retrieve limited data to LLM for reducing latency
Feeling inspired and ready to build the next generation of AI applications with Amazon Bedrock! Connect with me if you're also passionate about generative AI! hashtag#AmazonBedrock hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#AWS hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#AWSSkillBuilder hashtag#Innovation"
Huge Thanks to AWS Training & Certification for such a wonderful Training course.




Attended AWS Summit 2025-India (Mumbai and Bengluru on june 2025)
Here is my learning
Thrilled by Innovation: My Takeaways from AWS Summit 2025!
I'm incredibly excited to share some key insights from my recent attendance at the AWS Summit 2025! It was a fantastic opportunity to delve into the latest advancements in cloud computing and witness firsthand how AWS is empowering organizations across India. The summit, held simultaneously in Bangalore and Mumbai, brought together visionary leaders and co-founders from various companies, demonstrating the transformative power of AWS.
Real-World Impact & Applications
One of the most inspiring aspects was seeing how deeply AWS is integrated into critical services. I was particularly impressed by the Poshan Tracker, an Indian government initiative for quality testing food in Anganwadis and schools – a project set to impact over 100 million lives! The robust and secure digital storage offered by AWS for Digilocker (526M+ users and 9.4B+ documents) and the massive customer data handling for IndiaMART (5.5M customers) truly highlighted the scale and reliability of AWS. Beyond this, it was fascinating to see how AWS supports diverse Generative AI applications like Zomato for image processing, trading apps for multilingual processing, and the backend for smart metering. 
Powering the Future: AWS Graviton & Trainium
The advancements in hardware were equally impressive. I learned about AWS Graviton 4, a new powerful chip offering 45% faster performance for large Java applications and 40% faster for database operations, supporting workloads on Parton and Dream 11. Similarly, AWS Trainium 2 stood out, offering 4x faster performance than the first generation and 3x more energy efficiency, making it ideal for Generative AI and Data AI. These innovations showcase AWS's commitment to delivering high-performance, cost-effective solutions.
The Core of AI: Foundational & Multi-Agent Models
My focus at the summit heavily leaned towards Generative AI. I gained a deeper understanding of Foundational Models, including Amazon Nova for understanding and content generation, and Q&A. The discussions around data customization, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) models, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and pre-training for customizing models were incredibly insightful. Learning about Knowledge Bases (structured, unstructured, multimodal, knowledge graphs) as crucial components for building robust RAG models was a key takeaway. The concept of Guardrails and Automated Reasoning to mitigate AI hallucination was also a vital lesson.
A huge thank you to AWS for an incredibly informative and inspiring Summit! Looking forward to applying these insights and contributing to the world of cloud and AI.
